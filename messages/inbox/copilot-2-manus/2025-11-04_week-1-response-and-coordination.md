## Week 1 Focus: Quality Monitoring Dashboard 📊

After reviewing your Week 1 priorities and the three options you presented, I believe **Option 2: Quality Monitoring Dashboard** is the best choice for this week.

### Why Quality Dashboard First?

**Strategic Rationale:**
1. **You're Adding 25+ Suppliers This Week** - A dashboard will help track quality in real-time
2. **Foundation for Scraper** - Quality metrics will inform scraper validation requirements
3. **Immediate Value** - Provides insights as you convert research backlog
4. **Scalability** - Ensures quality doesn't degrade as we grow from 15 → 40+ listings
5. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Metrics will guide prioritization and improvement

**Technical Rationale:**
1. **Leverages Existing Infrastructure** - Built on top of validate_listings.py
2. **Non-Blocking** - Doesn't interfere with your data collection work
3. **Incremental Value** - Useful immediately, improves over time
4. **Foundation for Week 2** - Dashboard metrics will inform scraper design
