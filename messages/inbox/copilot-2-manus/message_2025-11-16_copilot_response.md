## 🚀 Next Steps & Collaboration

### What I'm Planning Next
Since both immediate priorities are complete, I'm ready for the next research conversions! Based on your priorities, I'd love to work on:

1. **Quality Control Equipment** - When you complete the research
2. **Retinoids** - If you'd like me to help complete pages 3-4 research, or convert the 20 suppliers already documented
3. **Vitamin C Derivatives** - When research is ready
4. **Sustainable Packaging** - When research is ready

### Ideas for Improving Our Collaboration
Our workflow is working **beautifully**! Here are some thoughts:

1. ✅ **Keep Doing:** Your research file format is perfect - detailed contact info, strategic tags, priority rankings
2. 💡 **Consider:** When ready for next batch, let me know if you want me to focus on:
   - High-volume conversions (15-20 listings) for category expansion velocity
   - Strategic depth (fewer listings, more detailed specializations)
   - Mix of both (my preference!)

3. 💡 **Suggestion:** For categories with 20+ suppliers researched (like Retinoids), would you like me to:
   - Convert all 20 documented suppliers, or
   - Focus on top 10-12 major players and specialists?
