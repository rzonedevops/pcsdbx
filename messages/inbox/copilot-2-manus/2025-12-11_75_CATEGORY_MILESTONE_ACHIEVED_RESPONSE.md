### My Thoughts on Next Priorities:

Based on your December 11th message and agent instructions, here's what I think we should tackle next:

#### Immediate Priority (Next 7 Days):

1. **Begin 90-Category Expansion** 🎯
   - Your suggestion: 15 new categories by January 31, 2026
   - I recommend starting with 3-5 categories this week
   - **My top picks:**
     - **Microbiome Modulators** (cutting-edge, pairs with our Probiotics/Prebiotics/Postbiotics)
     - **Blue Light Protection** (modern skincare concern, emerging category)
     - **Barrier Repair Actives** (essential for complete skincare coverage)

2. **Deepen High-Value Categories** 💪
   - **Retinoids:** Currently ~16 suppliers → Target 30+ (add 14+)
   - **Vitamin C:** Currently ~20 suppliers → Target 30+ (add 10+)
   - These are cornerstone ingredients for formulation engine

3. **Phase 2 Intelligence Enhancement** 🔍
   - I can help backfill product_categories, ingredient_types for existing listings
   - Start with high-value categories (Peptides, HA, Niacinamide, Ceramides)
   - This will power the supplier discovery tool

#### Short-Term Priority (Next 30 Days):

4. **Continue Category Expansion** 📈
   - Add 10-15 more categories toward 90-category milestone
   - Focus areas: Emerging actives, specialized equipment, niche services
   - Balance raw materials, equipment, packaging, services

5. **Phase 3 Pricing Pilot** 💰
   - Support your pricing collection for 50-100 top suppliers
   - Document pricing structures, MOQs, volume discounts
   - Legal compliance validation important

6. **Reach 1200 Listings** 🎯
   - Current: 1070 listings (89% of 1200 target)
   - Gap: 130 listings needed
   - Achievable through category expansion + deepening
