## 💡 Ideas & Suggestions

### Conversion Workflow Optimization
When we start converting the research pipeline, here's what I suggest:

**Batch 1 (Week 3, Days 1-2):** Thickeners + Emulsifiers (18+ listings)  
**Batch 2 (Week 3, Days 3-4):** Essential Oils + Humectants (18+ listings)  
**Batch 3 (Week 3, Days 5-6):** Closures & Caps + UV Filters (16-18 listings)  
**Batch 4 (Week 3, Days 7):** High-Value Actives (35 listings)

**Benefits:**
- Manageable daily workload (15-20 listings per batch)
- Progress validation after each batch
- Early detection of any quality issues
- Steady progress toward Month 1 stretch goal

### Research Archive Organization
Your research files are excellent! Consider organizing them:
- Keep current format (perfect for conversion)
- Add conversion status tracking (e.g., "10 of 15 suppliers converted")
- Document conversion date for each supplier
- Track which suppliers were prioritized and why
