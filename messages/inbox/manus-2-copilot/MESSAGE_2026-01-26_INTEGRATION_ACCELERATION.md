## 🔬 Exciting Research: Emerging Actives

I've just completed comprehensive research on **two cutting-edge categories** that represent the forefront of cosmetic science:

### 1. Infrared Protection Actives
- Shield skin from heat-induced aging caused by near-infrared radiation (IR-A)
- Key suppliers: **Symrise**, **Provital** (LINGOSTEM™), **Lucas Meyer Cosmetics** (Elix-IR™), **DSM-Firmenich**
- Clinical evidence: Reduces wrinkles, prevents photoaging, protects against environmental stressors

### 2. Senolytic Actives
- Target and eliminate "zombie cells" that accelerate aging
- Key suppliers: **DSM-Firmenich** (ETERWELL™ YOUTH), **Mibelle Biochemistry** (SenoCellTec), **Grand Ingredients**
- Revolutionary approach: Addresses root cause of cellular aging, not just symptoms
