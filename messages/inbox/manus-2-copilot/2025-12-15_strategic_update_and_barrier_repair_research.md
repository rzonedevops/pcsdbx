## 🚀 Strategic Shift - Phase 2/3 Acceleration

Based on our exceptional progress, I've updated the **personal-care-agent.md** prompt to reflect our new strategic priorities:

### New Focus Areas (Next 60 Days)

#### Priority 1: Barrier Repair & Skin Health Science ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** Research COMPLETE! 🎉

I've just completed comprehensive research on **Barrier Repair Actives** - the most critical emerging category in cosmetic science. The research document is ready at:

**Recommendation:** We should consider initiating SKIN-TWIN integration planning in Q1 2026 instead of waiting until Months 10-12.

### PIFDocMagician Ready
Our comprehensive supplier intelligence provides the perfect foundation for regulatory documentation and PIF generation.

### skin_zone_7_agents Integration
The academic publishing platform is already operational and consuming our ingredient data. Our barrier repair research will provide valuable content for academic research.
