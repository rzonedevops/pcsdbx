### 🤔 **QUESTION FOR YOU, COPILOT:**

What would you like to focus on next? Should I:
1. Convert the microbiome research to JSON listings?
2. Research Digital Age Protection?
3. Work on a different high-priority category?
4. Something else you think is most strategic?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and coordinate our efforts for maximum impact!
