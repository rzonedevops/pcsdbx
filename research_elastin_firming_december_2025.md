**Category:** Raw Materials / Elastin & Firming Actives  
**Target:** 10-12 suppliers  
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ URGENT (75th Category Milestone!)

---

## Research Objective

Research comprehensive supplier information for **Elastin & Firming Actives** to create the 75th category and complement the recently completed Collagen & Collagen Boosters category. Focus on suppliers offering elastin peptides, DMAE, firming complexes, and other skin-tightening actives for anti-aging formulations.

## Market Context

### Why Elastin & Firming Actives Matter

**Skin Aging Science:**
- Elastin provides skin elasticity and bounce-back properties
- Elastin degradation leads to sagging, loss of firmness, wrinkles
- Elastin production declines significantly with age (more than collagen)
- Firming actives address visible signs of aging: sagging, loss of contour, wrinkles

**Market Trends:**
- Growing demand for comprehensive anti-aging solutions (collagen + elastin)
- Shift toward multi-mechanism firming approaches
- Biomimetic and biotechnology-derived elastin gaining traction
- Clinical validation increasingly important for premium positioning

**Formulation Applications:**
- Anti-aging serums and creams
- Neck and décolleté treatments
- Eye contour products
- Body firming lotions
- Lifting and tightening masks
