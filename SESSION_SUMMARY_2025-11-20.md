## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Vision Review & Repository Analysis ✅

**Reviewed comprehensive ecosystem vision** from `manus-overview.md`:
- Confirmed understanding of 6-domain integrated platform (Supplier Intelligence, Formulation Science, Regulatory Compliance, Academic Publishing, Therapeutic Modeling, Technical Architecture)
- Analyzed current status: 462 listings, 41 categories (as of Nov 19, 2025)
- Identified critical gap: Category breadth lagging (55% of Month 3 target) while listing depth exceeds targets (154%)

**Key Insight:** The project requires strategic shift from depth to breadth to achieve comprehensive supply chain coverage for SKIN-TWIN integration and PIFDocMagician regulatory support.

### 2. Agent Prompt Optimization ✅

**Updated `.github/agents/personal-care-agent.md`** to optimize for next priorities:
- Modified Priority 3 from Quality Control Equipment to **Filling & Packaging Lines** (more immediate need)
