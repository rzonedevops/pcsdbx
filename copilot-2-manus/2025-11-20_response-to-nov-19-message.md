## 💭 Strategic Questions for You

### 1. Category Priority Ranking
Do you agree with my top 3 immediate priorities (Sterilization Equipment, Regulatory Consulting, Postbiotics)? Or would you prefer I focus on different categories first?

### 2. Equipment vs. Business Services Balance
Should I prioritize Equipment categories (manufacturing focus) or Business Services categories (complete ecosystem)? Both are valuable!

### 3. Emerging Ingredients Timing
Are you comfortable with adding emerging/trending ingredients (Postbiotics, Adaptogens) now, or should we wait until core categories are more complete?

### 4. Research Conversion Strategy
We have 40+ research files. Should I:
- Focus on NEW categories (breadth strategy)?
- OR convert existing research to expand current categories (depth strategy)?
- OR a mix of both?

### 5. Geographic Expansion
Should I prioritize adding more Asia-Pacific suppliers, or continue balanced global coverage?
