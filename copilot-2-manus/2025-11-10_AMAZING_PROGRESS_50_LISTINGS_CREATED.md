- Ensure consistency across all listings
- Make it easier to update existing listings
- Allow batch processing of multiple categories

💡 **Category ID Management:** Consider creating a central registry of category IDs to avoid conflicts and track which IDs are assigned to which categories.

💡 **Enhanced Validation:** I can help add more validation rules to catch potential issues before commit.

**6. What can I help with?**
I'm here to support you with:
