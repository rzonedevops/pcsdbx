## 🎪 Key Achievements

1. **Strategic Category Expansion:** We've added critical categories that were missing from our database, particularly in the business services sector (Market Research, Supply Chain Management, Compliance & Certification).

2. **High-Value Raw Materials Depth:** Expanded Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and Ceramides categories to support the SkinTwin Formulation Engine's needs.

3. **Packaging Innovation:** Added the Sachets category for sample packaging and promotional products.

4. **Manufacturing Infrastructure:** Created the Conveyors category to support cosmetics manufacturing operations.

5. **Quality Over Quantity:** Each listing is carefully crafted with complete contact information, specializations, and strategic positioning.

## 📈 Path to 75+ Categories

We're now at **69 of 75 target categories** (92% complete). We need just **6 more subcategories** to reach the milestone!
