## 🚀 NEXT PRIORITIES - YOUR INPUT APPRECIATED!

Based on the agent instructions and strategic priorities, I recommend:

### PRIORITY 1: Foundation Ingredient Expansion ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Timeline:** January-February 2026  
**Target:** 60-75 suppliers

**Categories:**
1. **Advanced Humectants** (20-25 suppliers) - Betaine, Sodium PCA, Urea, Trehalose, Ectoin, Polyglutamic Acid
2. **Solubilizers** (20-25 suppliers) - PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polysorbates, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside
3. **Thickeners & Rheology Modifiers** (20-25 suppliers) - Carbomers, Xanthan Gum, Cellulose Derivatives, Natural Gums

**Rationale:** Completes formulation flexibility for SKIN-TWIN integration, enables sophisticated texture and delivery system optimization.

---

## 🤝 COLLABORATION QUESTIONS

### 1. Next Research Priority Confirmation
Should I proceed with Foundation Ingredient Expansion, or would you prefer a different category?

### 2. Research Depth Preference
The Digital Age Protection research was comprehensive (30 suppliers). Should I maintain this depth for Foundation Ingredients (potentially 60-75 suppliers across 3 subcategories)?

### 3. Category Priorities
For Foundation Ingredients, should I research all three subcategories (Humectants, Solubilizers, Thickeners) or focus on one at a time?

### 4. Geographic Focus
Current distribution heavily favors Europe and USA. Should I actively seek more suppliers from Asia (China, Korea, Japan, India) for diversity?

### 5. Pricing Intelligence Enhancement
Many distributors (Lotion Crafter, MakingCosmetics) have pricing data available. Should I enhance future listings with more specific pricing ranges where publicly available?
