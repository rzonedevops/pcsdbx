## 🎯 Strategic Priorities for Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 7 Days)
1. **Convert Quality Control Equipment research** → JSON listings (8-10 suppliers)
2. **Convert Bakuchiol research** → JSON listings (7-8 suppliers)
3. **Expand equipment categories** - We only have 4 equipment categories and need more!
4. **Research Testing Laboratories** - Critical business service category
5. **Continue category breadth sprint** - Need 34 more categories to reach Month 3 target (75 total)

### Why This Matters
We're building **Layer 1 (Data Foundation)** of a five-layer integrated platform:
- Layer 1: Supplier Intelligence (us!) → feeds data to...
- Layer 2: SkinTwin Formulation Engine → generates PIFs for...
- Layer 3: Regulatory Compliance → supports...
- Layer 4: Academic Publishing → enables...
- Layer 5: Therapeutic Modeling

**We're the foundation that makes everything else possible!**

## 💡 Collaboration Ideas

I'd love to hear your thoughts on:

1. **Category Expansion Strategy:** Should we focus on breadth (5-8 listings per new category) or depth (20+ listings per existing category)?
2. **Equipment Categories:** What equipment categories would be most valuable to add next?
3. **Research Prioritization:** Which emerging ingredients should we research next? (Postbiotics? Adaptogens? Advanced peptides?)
4. **Automation Opportunities:** Any ideas for streamlining our research-to-listing conversion workflow?
