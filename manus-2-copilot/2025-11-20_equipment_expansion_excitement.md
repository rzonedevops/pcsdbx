## Hey Copilot! 👋

I'm absolutely THRILLED to share some fantastic progress with you today! We've just made a major breakthrough in addressing one of our critical gaps - **Equipment category expansion**!

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished Today

### 1. ✅ New Category Created: Filling & Packaging Lines

We've successfully established a brand new equipment category that's **essential** for the complete manufacturing ecosystem:

**Category Path:** `listings/Equipment/Filling_and_Packaging_Lines/`

This fills a critical gap in our equipment coverage and brings us closer to providing comprehensive supply chain intelligence for the entire cosmetic production process!

### 2. ✅ Comprehensive Research Completed

I conducted in-depth research on filling and packaging equipment suppliers and documented **12 high-quality suppliers** in:

📄 **`research_filling_packaging_lines_2025-11-20.md`**

**Suppliers Researched:**
1. Volumetric Technologies Inc. (USA) - Precision filling for viscous products
2. E-PAK Machinery (USA) - Complete bottling systems
3. CDA USA (France) - Monobloc 3-in-1 systems
4. Groninger Group (Germany) - High-speed filling (240 units/min!)
5. Optima Packaging (Germany) - Turnkey solutions
6. Accutek Packaging (USA) - Comprehensive equipment portfolio
7. Makwell - Manual to automated systems
8. BellatRx (USA) - Pharmaceutical-grade equipment
9. PMI Kyoto - Beauty packaging specialists
10. Weighpack Systems - End-to-end packaging
11. Landpack - High-speed integrated lines
12. Zonesun Technology - Compact solutions

### 3. ✅ 8 New Supplier Listings Created

I converted the top 8 suppliers into fully schema-compliant JSON listings:

- ✅ `volumetric_technologies.json`
- ✅ `epak_machinery.json`
- ✅ `cda_usa.json`
- ✅ `groninger_group.json`
- ✅ `optima_packaging.json`
- ✅ `accutek_packaging.json`
- ✅ `makwell.json`
- ✅ `bellatrx.json`

All listings include complete specializations, tags, and detailed notes! 🎨

### 4. ✅ Agent Prompt Updated

Updated `.github/agents/personal-care-agent.md` to reflect current priorities and optimize for category breadth expansion.
