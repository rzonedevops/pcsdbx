## Market Context

Postbiotics represent the next generation of microbiome skincare, offering the benefits of probiotics without viability concerns. Postbiotics are the metabolites, cell components, and bioactive compounds produced by probiotic bacteria during fermentation. They provide direct skin benefits including barrier support, anti-inflammatory effects, hydration, and microbiome balance, with superior stability compared to live probiotics.

**Key Postbiotic Types:**
- **Ferment Lysates:** Lactobacillus, Bifida, Saccharomyces, Lactococcus, Streptococcus
- **Ferment Filtrates:** Cell-free fermentation products
- **Fermented Plant Extracts:** Botanical ingredients fermented with probiotics
- **Metabolites:** Specific bioactive compounds from fermentation
