## Milestone Progress Evaluation

### Vision Component 1: Build Comprehensive Supplier Database

**Target:** Complete database of all personal care suppliers globally (313+ categories, 1000+ suppliers)

**Current Status:**
- Listings tracked: **48 of 1000+ target (4.8%)**
- Categories covered: **8 of 309 target (2.6%)**
- Schema maturity: **v1.0 deployed, 100% compliance**
- Data quality: **100% schema compliance, improving enhanced field coverage**

**Progress Since Last Evaluation:**
- Listings: +33 (220% increase)
- Categories: +3 (60% increase)
- Research files: +3 strategic categories documented
- Suppliers researched: +27 new suppliers

**Progress Assessment:** 🟢 **STRONG ACCELERATION - ON TRACK**

The project has demonstrated the ability to scale rapidly while maintaining quality standards. The addition of 33 listings in a short period shows that the research-to-conversion workflow is effective. The expansion into 3 new strategic categories (Emollients, Botanical Extracts, Preservatives) aligns perfectly with SkinTwin formulation needs.

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Velocity Gap:** Current pace is strong but must be sustained with automation support
- **Category Gap:** 8 of 309 categories (2.6%) - need systematic expansion process
- **Conversion Gap:** 80+ suppliers in research pipeline - excellent conversion opportunity

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate (Week 2):** Deploy conversion tool to accelerate research-to-listing workflow
2. **Week 3:** Deploy web scraper to increase collection velocity 10x
3. **Month 2:** Establish systematic category expansion (5+ new categories per week)
4. **Ongoing:** Maintain 80%+ research-to-listing conversion rate

**Revised Timeline:**
- **Month 1 (Nov 2025):** 75+ listings, 15+ categories ✅ **ON TRACK**
- **Month 3 (Jan 2026):** 200+ listings, 75+ categories
- **Month 6 (Apr 2026):** 500+ listings, 150+ categories
