# Research: Emerging Actives - Infrared Protection & Senolytics (January 26, 2026)

## Executive Summary

This research document focuses on **two cutting-edge categories of cosmetic actives** that represent the forefront of anti-aging and photoprotection science: **Infrared Protection Actives** and **Senolytic Actives**. These next-generation ingredients address emerging consumer concerns about environmental stressors and cellular aging, positioning them as critical additions to the pcsdbx supplier database.

### Key Findings

**Infrared Protection Actives** shield skin from heat-induced aging caused by near-infrared radiation (IR-A, 700-1400 nm), which penetrates deeper than UV rays and contributes to wrinkle formation, collagen degradation, and oxidative stress. Major suppliers include **Symrise**, **Provital**, **Lucas Meyer Cosmetics (Clariant)**, and **DSM-Firmenich**.

**Senolytic Actives** target and eliminate senescent cells (zombie cells) that accumulate with age and contribute to chronic inflammation, collagen loss, and accelerated aging. Leading suppliers include **DSM-Firmenich** (ETERWELL™ YOUTH), **Mibelle Biochemistry** (SenoCellTec), and **Grand Ingredients** (fermented cellular senescence modulators).

## Part 1: Infrared Protection Actives

### Scientific Background

While the cosmetic industry has long focused on UV protection (UVB 280-320 nm and UVA 320-400 nm), research since the 1980s has revealed that **infrared radiation** (700 nm - 1 mm), particularly **near-infrared (IR-A, 700-1400 nm)**, penetrates deeply into the skin and causes significant damage. IR-A radiation induces heat stress, oxidative damage, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, leading to collagen and elastin degradation and accelerated photoaging.

### Key Mechanisms of IR-A Damage

1. **Heat-Induced Stress**: IR-A generates heat in the skin, triggering inflammatory responses and oxidative stress
2. **Oxidative Damage**: IR-A increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, damaging cellular components
3. **MMP Activation**: IR-A upregulates matrix metalloproteinases that degrade collagen and elastin
4. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**: IR-A disrupts mitochondrial function, reducing cellular energy production
5. **Wrinkle Formation**: Combined effects accelerate visible signs of aging, particularly wrinkles and loss of firmness

## Part 2: Senolytic Actives

### Scientific Background

**Cellular senescence** is a state in which cells cease to divide but remain metabolically active, accumulating with age and contributing to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. These **senescent cells**, often called "zombie cells," secrete pro-inflammatory factors (SASP - Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype) that damage surrounding healthy cells and accelerate aging.

**Senolytics** are compounds that selectively target and eliminate senescent cells, allowing the body's natural regeneration processes to restore tissue health. In skincare, senolytic actives represent a revolutionary approach to anti-aging by addressing the root cause of cellular aging rather than just treating symptoms.

### Key Mechanisms of Senolytic Action

1. **Selective Elimination**: Senolytics specifically target senescent cells while preserving healthy cells
2. **SASP Reduction**: Eliminating senescent cells reduces chronic inflammation and tissue damage
3. **Stem Cell Activation**: Removing senescent cells allows skin stem cells to function optimally
4. **Collagen Restoration**: Senolytic action enables fibroblasts to resume collagen and elastin production
5. **Barrier Repair**: Improved keratinocyte stem cell function strengthens the skin barrier
