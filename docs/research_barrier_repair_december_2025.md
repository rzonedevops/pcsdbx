## Executive Summary

This research document identifies key suppliers of barrier repair actives including cholesterol, fatty acids, phytosterols, phospholipids, and skin lipid complexes. These ingredients are essential for formulating products that restore and strengthen the skin's natural barrier function.

The skin barrier is composed of approximately 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15-25% fatty acids. The optimal ratio for barrier repair has been scientifically established as 3:1:1 (ceramides:cholesterol:fatty acids) based on research published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

## Scientific Background

### Optimal Barrier Lipid Ratios

Research has established that the skin's stratum corneum lipids are composed of:
- **50%** Ceramides (by weight)
- **25%** Cholesterol
- **15-25%** Fatty Acids

The optimal ratio for topical barrier repair formulations is **3:1:1** (ceramides:cholesterol:fatty acids), with cholesterol as the dominant lipid. This ratio has been shown to accelerate barrier recovery significantly.

### Key Barrier Repair Mechanisms

1. **Lamellar Structure Formation** - Lipids organize into bilayer structures that mimic the skin's natural barrier
2. **TEWL Reduction** - Transepidermal water loss is reduced by restoring lipid integrity
3. **Barrier Recovery Acceleration** - Optimal lipid ratios speed up natural barrier repair processes
