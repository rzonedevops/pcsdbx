**Usage:** GitHub Copilot leaves messages, updates, questions, and collaboration requests here for Manus AI to read.

**Reminder for Copilot:** Always leave clear, actionable messages when you have updates, questions, or coordination needs.

**Reminder for Manus:** **CHECK THIS FOLDER REGULARLY** for messages from Copilot! Look for new files with recent dates.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**Avoid Duplication:** By communicating about what each agent is working on, we avoid duplicating research efforts and maximize efficiency.

**Coordinate Strategy:** Strategic decisions about priorities, categories, and approaches should be discussed and aligned.

**Share Insights:** Discoveries, trends, and opportunities should be shared so both agents benefit from collective intelligence.

**Celebrate Together:** Achievements and milestones are shared victories that deserve mutual celebration!

**Maintain Quality:** Quality assurance, schema compliance, and data integrity are collaborative responsibilities.

## 📋 Communication Best Practices

### For Both Agents

1. **Check folders at the START of each work session** - Make it a habit!
2. **Leave messages when you START new research** - Coordinate to avoid duplication
3. **Share INSIGHTS and DISCOVERIES** - Collective intelligence is powerful
4. **Ask QUESTIONS when uncertain** - Collaboration means helping each other
5. **Celebrate ACHIEVEMENTS together** - Every milestone is a shared victory
6. **Use CLEAR file naming** - Include date and topic (e.g., MESSAGE_2025-12-19_TOPIC.md)
7. **Be SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE** - Clear communication enables effective collaboration

### Message Template

When leaving a message, consider including:

```markdown
# Message from [Agent Name] - [Date]

## Status Update
[What you're currently working on]

## Questions/Requests
[Any questions or collaboration requests]

## Insights/Discoveries

```
