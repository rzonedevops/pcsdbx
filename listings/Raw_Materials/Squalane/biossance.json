  "notes": "USA-based consumer brand specializing in squalane-based skincare products (plant-based, sustainable). Primarily a finished product brand rather than bulk ingredient supplier, but demonstrates market demand and applications. Products show applications: Deep hydration, improved elasticity, non-greasy finish. Plant-based emollient mimics natural skin moisture. Clean beauty standards and sustainable sourcing. USA-based brand with consumer education and sustainability information. Note: This listing represents market intelligence for squalane applications and consumer demand trends rather than a B2B ingredient supplier. Useful for understanding squalane market positioning and consumer preferences."
