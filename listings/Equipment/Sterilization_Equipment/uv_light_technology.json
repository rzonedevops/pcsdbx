  "notes": "UV Light Technology Limited specializes in ultraviolet germicidal sterilization systems that offer a chemical-free, heat-free alternative to traditional autoclaves. Their UV-C systems (254nm wavelength) are particularly valuable for cosmetic manufacturers working with heat-sensitive materials, packaging components, or surfaces that cannot withstand steam sterilization. UV sterilization is fast (15-30 minutes), energy-efficient, and requires minimal maintenance. While UV sterilization is surface-only (no penetration into materials), it's highly effective for sterilizing work surfaces, packaging materials, clean room environments, and tools. At $1,000-$5,000, UV systems provide an affordable entry point for small manufacturers and an excellent complement to traditional sterilization methods."
