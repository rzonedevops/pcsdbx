## Category 3: Barrier Repair Science - Fatty Acids (Cosmetic Grade)

### Research Notes on Fatty Acids:

**Key Fatty Acids for Barrier Repair:**
1. **Linoleic Acid** (Omega-6, polyunsaturated)
   - Sources: Cranberry seed oil, black raspberry seed oil, chia seed oil, prickly pear seed oil
   - Critical for proper barrier function
   
2. **Oleic Acid** (Omega-9, monounsaturated)
   - Note: Oily and acneic skin should use oils with less than 50% oleic acid
   
3. **Palmitic Acid** (C16, saturated)
   - Found naturally in human skin
   - Main fatty acid in lanolin
   
4. **Stearic Acid** (C18, saturated)
   - Barrier-supporting saturated fat
   - Acts as both an emollient and stabilizer

5. **Ricinoleic Acid** (monounsaturated)
   - Thick consistency
   - Specific applications for certain skin types

**Optimal Ratio for Barrier Repair:**
- Ceramides : Cholesterol : Fatty Acids = 1:1:1
- This ratio mimics the skin's natural lipid composition
- Essential for lamellar bilayer formation
- Protects against transepidermal water loss (TEWL)

### Barrier Repair Formulation Examples:
- **Barrier Lipid Complex** products combine ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids
- Used by brands like CAP Beauty, Marie Veronique
- Contract manufacturers like Zerun Cosmetic specialize in barrier repair formulations
