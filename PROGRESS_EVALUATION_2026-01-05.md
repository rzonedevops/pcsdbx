## Critical Gaps & Strategic Priorities

### Gap 1: Category Depth Expansion
**Current:** 79 categories  
**Target:** 309 categories (Year 1)  
**Gap:** 230 categories (74.4% remaining)

**Impact:** Limits product-supplier mapping precision, SKIN-TWIN formulation intelligence, and competitive differentiation

**Recommendation:** Prioritize category expansion with focus on:
1. **Microbiome Intelligence** (8-10 new categories) - Revolutionary science
2. **Barrier Repair Science** (5-6 new categories) - Critical for PsoTheraDRH
3. **Digital Age Protection** (4-5 new categories) - Market trend
4. **Equipment Expansion** (15-20 new categories) - Manufacturing gap
5. **Foundation Ingredient Depth** (10-15 new categories) - Formulation flexibility

**Timeline:** 230 categories over 10 months = 23 categories/month = 5-6 categories/week

### Gap 2: Pricing Intelligence Infrastructure
**Current:** No pricing data collected  
**Target:** Comparative pricing for 500+ products (Phase 3)

**Impact:** Limits supplier comparison, cost optimization, and competitive analysis

**Recommendation:** Launch pilot pricing intelligence collection for top 50 suppliers in high-value categories. Develop pricing data collection methodology and competitive analysis framework.

**Timeline:** Pilot launch by February 15, 2026; Full rollout by June 30, 2026

### Gap 3: Product-Supplier Mapping
