Postbiotics are the HOTTEST emerging trend in skin microbiome science! They are non-living bacterial products or metabolic byproducts from probiotic microorganisms that have beneficial effects on the skin without the complexity and stability challenges of live probiotics. Postbiotics include:
- Bacterial lysates and cell fragments
- Fermentation metabolites (peptides, enzymes, organic acids)
- Cell wall components (peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acids)
- Secreted proteins and enzymes

## Market Context
The postbiotics market is exploding due to:
- Growing consumer interest in skin microbiome health
- Scientific validation of microbiome-skin connection
