## Research Summary

Postbiotics represent the next generation of microbiome-friendly cosmetic ingredients. Unlike probiotics (live bacteria) or prebiotics (food for bacteria), postbiotics are the beneficial metabolites, cell wall fragments, enzymes, and bioactive compounds produced by probiotic bacteria. They offer stability advantages over live cultures while delivering skin microbiome benefits including barrier strengthening, anti-inflammatory effects, and enhanced skin health. This emerging category is gaining significant traction in the clean beauty and science-backed skincare markets.
