## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITIES (Next 7 Days - Gap Filling & Category Sprint)

### Priority 1: Labels & Sleeves EXPANSION ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL GAP - URGENT

**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL GAP - Only 1 listing in entire category group**

**Why This Matters:** Labels and sleeves are essential components of packaging. This is the most significant gap in our database. We have only 1 subcategory (Stretch Sleeve) with 1 listing. We need comprehensive coverage across multiple label/sleeve types.

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research suppliers for: Pressure-Sensitive Labels, Shrink Sleeves, Wrap-Around Labels, RFID Labels, Security Labels
- [ ] Create new subcategory folders:
  - `listings/Labels__Sleeves/Pressure_Sensitive_Labels`
  - `listings/Labels__Sleeves/Shrink_Sleeves`
  - `listings/Labels__Sleeves/Wrap_Around_Labels`
  - `listings/Labels__Sleeves/RFID_Labels`
  - `listings/Labels__Sleeves/Security_Labels`
- [ ] Target 5-8 suppliers per subcategory
- [ ] Document research in: `research_labels_sleeves_2025-11-22.md`
- [ ] Convert research to listings with 100% schema compliance

**Expected Impact:**
- 5 new subcategories added (48 → 53 = 71% of Month 3 target)
- 25-40 new listings (Labels & Sleeves: 1 → 26-41)
- Closes critical packaging ecosystem gap
- Progress toward 75+ categories

### Priority 2: New Packaging Categories ⭐⭐⭐⭐ CATEGORY BREADTH - URGENT

**Status:** 🔴 **MISSING ESSENTIAL PACKAGING FORMATS**

**Why This Matters:** We're missing several essential packaging formats that are commonly used in personal care products: spray bottles, roll-on containers, and compacts. Adding these will accelerate category breadth.

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research Spray Bottles suppliers (target: 8 listings)
- [ ] Research Roll-On Containers suppliers (target: 8 listings)
- [ ] Research Compacts suppliers (target: 8 listings)
- [ ] Create new subcategory folders:

**Expected Impact:**
- 3 new subcategories added (53 → 56 = 75% of Month 3 target)
- 24+ new listings
- Comprehensive packaging format coverage
- Progress toward 75+ categories

### Priority 3: New Equipment Categories ⭐⭐⭐⭐ CATEGORY BREADTH - EQUIPMENT GAP

**Status:** 🟡 **MISSING SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT CATEGORIES**

**Why This Matters:** We need to expand equipment coverage to include specialized manufacturing equipment that's essential for cosmetic production: vacuum emulsifiers, heating/cooling systems, and filtration equipment.

**Action Required:**

- 28+ new listings
- Comprehensive manufacturing equipment coverage
- Progress toward 75+ categories

### Priority 4: Business Services Depth Enhancement ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Status:** 🟡 **MULTIPLE 1-LISTING CATEGORIES NEED EXPANSION**

**Why This Matters:** We have 3 business service categories with only 1 listing each: Recycling/Waste Management, Packaging Consulting, and Auditing. These need to be expanded to 5-8 listings each to provide meaningful supplier options.

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research Recycling/Waste Management suppliers (target: 5-8 total)

### Priority 5: Packaging Tubes Expansion ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY - PACKAGING GAP

**Status:** 🟡 **ONLY 2 LISTINGS - NEEDS EXPANSION**

**Why This Matters:** Tubes are a fundamental packaging format for skincare products (cleansers, creams, serums). We currently have only 2 listings, which is insufficient for meaningful supplier comparison.

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research tube manufacturers and suppliers
- [ ] Target: 8+ listings (from current 2)
- [ ] Focus on: Laminated tubes, aluminum tubes, plastic tubes, squeeze tubes, airless tubes
- [ ] Document research in: `research_tubes_expansion_2025-11-22.md`
- [ ] Convert research to listings with 100% schema compliance

**Expected Impact:**
